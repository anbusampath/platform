    * Cyclic dependency between CDI and Transactions
    * Test dependencies on APIs
    * Platform Web-API
    * JMS
    * CDI - will remove Transactions/EJB javadoc dependencies
    * Faces
    * EJB
    * Resource 

* Discussion
    * Is a course grained maven deps analysis like this useful?
    * Platform and Profiles define which level of component specifications that it is composed from
    * Transitive dependencies are not that important in this context
    * Is it a problem that Transactions pulls in CDI 3.0 (provided)?
        * Transactions runs fine with CDI 4.0, so this will be solved when 
    * DECISION: We will **NOT** do a new release of Transactions for EE 10
